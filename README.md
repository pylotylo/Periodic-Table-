Most Recent Updates! (as of 02/27/2020)
here is a (nearly) functioning table framework, with the working mouse detection feature!

I still need to adjust the scaling of the text 
to change along with the size of the user 
window. Hopefully this will be fairly 
easy to achieve.

Once this is complete, I'll start working on 
popup modules for each element, which 
additional information regarding the 
properties of each element that are useful
in chemistry bookwork and lab work!

I've also tried to convert the list of 
element constants in both a separate JS file
as well a a JSON file, but have had some 
issues loading those in the framework.js
file. I'll return to that issue at somepoint
if need be, but for now things are moving in
the right direction
_____________________________________________

learning JS as I work on this, 
ideally would like to make this interactive,
ie: add kinetics and additional 
information for each element
_____________________________________________
need to really sit down and learn a compiler 
language to really tie this together,
i'm currently working on the framework for
the table itself, namely, how the mouse will
interact with each element.

The javascript framework for the table is 
almost complete. I'm shifting focus now 
towards learning more about HTML and CSS, as 
well as other working platforms. Namely, I'm
considering using VS code, as opposed to 
Sublime Text. I've had issues with installing
extensions in Sublime Text, possibly because
I haven't registered my software pack/payed 
for use. VS code seems a little easier to use
and has some additional feature that make it 
more appealing than Sublime Text.
