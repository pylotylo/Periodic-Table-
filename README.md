# Periodic-Table-
learning JS as I work on this, 
ideally would like to make this interactive,
ie: add kinetics and additional 
information for each element
_____________________________________________
need to really sit down and learn a compiler 
language to really tie this together,
i'm currently working on the framework for
the table itself, namely, how the mouse will
interact with each element.
